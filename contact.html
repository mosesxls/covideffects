                <h1>How the lives of the Vendors has changed as a result of the Pandemic</h1>
                 <ul>
                                <li>One of the charcoal sellers also stated that ever since this pandemic hit the country, everything has changed and their business is moving very slowly 
</li>
                                <li>The closure of Makerere University also led to a great reduction on the number of their customers since they were the most buyers of their goods
</li>
                                <li>The restaurants that used to provide market for some of the food stuffs and charcoal are no longer cooking like they used to which also increased their losses
</li>
                                <li>One of the meat sellers also said that their customers who used to buy like 4kgs of meat would now opt for 1kg and the ones who used to buy like 1kg would now go to buy 1 cup of beans instead
</li>
                                <li>The market vendors were not forced to pay rent but they know they have to pay it no matter what
</li>
                                <li>One of the vendors by the name of John stated that they no longer have savings out of the sales of their goods because the little they earn is spent on survival</li>
                                <li>Most of the market vendors in Wandegeya Market also complaint of a big decline in the number of sales each day due to few customers for their goods
</li>
                                <li>The most critical challenge that these vendors faced was issue of payment of rent since they were not earning enough money to cater for the  rent
</li>
                                <li>Another big challenge was issue of losses made due to the issues of curfew whereby they have to stop selling by 6pm hence leading to great losses
</li>
                                <li>Some of the properties of the vendors who were commuting from home were also getting spoilt while the ones who were sleeping in the market managed to keep their properties from getting spoilt
</li>
                            


                            </ul>

                <h1>How Uganda has changed as a result of the pandemic</h1>
                <ul>
                                <li>Factory closures in China have resulted in supply chain disruptions
</li>
                                <li>There has been a decline in Foreign Direct Investment FDI and remittances from diaspora. China is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world. There will be a significant decline in FDI inflows into China as a result of the coronavirus
</li>
                                <li>The tourism sector and its related industries will suffer most. The tourism sector will be the hardest hit by coronavirus as the as Government issues travel warning to people travelling to, and out of Uganda, under its policy “social distancing” in order to prevent and contain infections.
</li>
                                <li>Tax collections will also be affected. Currently, about 42% of all the tax collected in Uganda is from international trade. This tax is mainly in the form of VAT and import duty on imports, and excise duty on the importation of petroleum products.
</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                             <h1>Recommendations</h1>
                <ul>
                                <li>Most of the vendors were requesting the government to help them and pay for their rent since they have not been earning much from their sales
</li>
                                <li>Some vendors also were requesting the government to open other places like bars and other institutions so that they would increase market for their sales
</li>
                                <li>One of the vendors also requested the government to give them loans without interests involved
</li>
                                <li>The government should also reduce or exempt the vendors from paying taxes since they have not been making enough money to cover their taxes
</li>
                                <li>Use of technology for access to credit should also be escalated during this crisis. For example, mobile money and other e-platforms can simplify loan application processes and reduce turnaround times of MSME loans.
</li>
                                 <li>The Credit Reporting Bureau should be on the lookout for unintended defaults. In this case, all financial institutions should continue to share credit information with regulators. 
</li>
                                <li>Finally, the government should consider amending the legal framework on bankruptcy with temporary measures to prevent liquidation.

</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                             <h1>How COCIS could Improve its Responses towards the Pandemic</h1>
                <ul>
                                <li>COCIS can help in designing an Online system for marketing whereby vendors can contact their clients and sell their goods online 
</li>
                                <li>COCIS can also assist in disseminating information regarding how to control the pandemic through creating a website for dissemination
</li>
                                
                               
                                
                            </ul>
                             <h1> Conclusion 
 </h1>
                            <ul>
                                 <li>The outbreak of COVID 19 world wide has really affected the Market vendors in Uganda in a number of ways. The government of Uganda imposed control measures to be observed by everyone such as curfew, social distancing etc but these measures also had a lot of negative impact on the sellers in market such as few customers, inability to pay rent, losses, theft among others
</li>
                                <li>Therefore the government of Uganda should find ways of reducing these challenges by reducing taxes, paying of rent for the vendors.
</li>
